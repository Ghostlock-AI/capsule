# UNFINISHED SESSION - Forensic Tracking Implementation

## Session Summary
We were implementing comprehensive forensic tracking for AI agent security monitoring in waves. Made significant progress but **Wave 4 was not actually implemented** - only designed and discussed.

## ‚úÖ Completed Waves

### Wave 1: Enhanced Data Model (COMPLETED)
- **File**: `capsule-runtime/src/model.rs`
- **What**: Added 25+ forensic data structures to SyscallEvent
- **Fields Added**: `process_forensics`, `file_forensics`, `network_forensics`, `memory_forensics`, `security_forensics`, `signal_forensics`, `environment_forensics`, `permission_analysis`, `forensic_summary`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and working

### Wave 2: Enhanced Parser (COMPLETED) 
- **File**: `capsule-runtime/src/parser/forensic.rs` (NEW FILE)
- **What**: Detailed forensic context extraction from strace output
- **Functions**: `parse_file_open_context()`, `parse_socket_creation_context()`, `parse_memory_operation_context()`, etc.
- **Integration**: Added `forensic::parse_forensic_context()` call in `parser.rs`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and working

### Wave 3: Enhanced Enricher (COMPLETED)
- **File**: `capsule-runtime/src/enricher.rs`
- **What**: /proc filesystem correlation with forensic data
- **Functions**: `enhance_process_forensics()`, `enhance_file_forensics()`, `enhance_network_forensics()`, etc.
- **Features**: Process genealogy, file metadata, socket state resolution, memory mapping analysis
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and working

## ‚ùå INCOMPLETE: Wave 4 - Enhanced Aggregation & Human Translation

### What Was Planned
Transform low-level syscalls into human-readable behavioral descriptions like:
```
"Agent analyzed Python project: read 47 source files (2.3MB), executed git status, 
uploaded 3 modified files to GitHub API [‚ö†Ô∏è 2 security events] [patterns: file_read_pattern]"
```

### What Was NOT Implemented
1. **Pattern Detection Functions** - The pattern recognition code was **described but never coded**
2. **Behavioral Translation** - Template-based natural language generation **not implemented**
3. **Agent Workflow Classification** - AgentWorkflow enum **not implemented**
4. **Enhanced Action Descriptions** - The aggregator still produces basic descriptions

### Critical Issue
- User tested with `grep "part of|patterns|security" ~/.capsule/logs/*/actions.jsonl` and found **nothing**
- This confirms Wave 4 was never actually implemented, only discussed
- The aggregator code changes shown in the conversation **were never actually made**

## üîß What Needs To Be Done Next

### Immediate: Implement Wave 4 Actually
1. **File**: `capsule-runtime/src/aggregator.rs`
2. **Add These Data Structures**:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
   enum AgentWorkflow {
       FileAnalysis { files_analyzed: u32, total_bytes: u64 },
       NetworkCommunication { apis_called: Vec<String> },
       CodeGeneration { files_created: Vec<String> },
       RepositoryOperation { commands: Vec<String> },
       SystemExploration,
   }
   
   #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
   struct ForensicContext {
       has_process_context: bool,
       has_file_context: bool,
       risk_indicators: Vec<String>,
   }
   ```

3. **Add These Functions**:
   ```rust
   fn detect_syscall_patterns(syscall_sequence: &[String]) -> Vec<String>
   fn generate_enhanced_action_summary(pending_action: &PendingAction) -> String
   fn classify_agent_workflow(ev: &SyscallEvent) -> Option<AgentWorkflow>
   fn extract_forensic_context(ev: &SyscallEvent) -> ForensicContext
   ```

4. **Modify PendingAction struct** to include:
   ```rust
   forensic_contexts: Vec<ForensicContext>,
   behavioral_patterns: Vec<String>,
   agent_workflow: Option<AgentWorkflow>,
   ```

5. **Update finalize_action()** to call enhanced summary generation

### Testing Commands
Once implemented, test with commands that generate multiple syscalls:
```bash
# File enumeration pattern
./target/debug/capsule run find /usr/include -name "*.h" | head -20

# Network pattern  
./target/debug/capsule run curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux

# File read pattern
./target/debug/capsule run python3 -c "
for i in range(5):
    with open(f'/tmp/test{i}', 'w') as f: f.write('test')
for i in range(5):
    with open(f'/tmp/test{i}', 'r') as f: f.read()
"

# Then verify:
grep -E "part of|patterns|security" ~/.capsule/logs/*/actions.jsonl
```

## üìã Remaining Todo Items

### High Priority
- **Build syscall-to-human-readable action translation layer** (THIS IS WAVE 4!)
- **Implement AI-powered session summarization and risk assessment** 
- **Build comprehensive risk profiling system with default seccomp enforcement**
- **Create brew formula, Linux installer, and Docker container**

### Medium Priority  
- **Implement macOS compatibility layer using dtruss/dtrace**
- **Build user-friendly CLI interface with session management**

## üéØ Next Session Goals

1. **FIRST**: Actually implement Wave 4 behavioral aggregation 
2. **VERIFY**: Test that enhanced descriptions appear in actions.jsonl
3. **THEN**: Move to AI-powered session summarization (Wave 5)

## üìù Phase-Based Architecture Notes

The implementation follows a 3-phase evolution:
- **Phase 1**: Rule-based pattern recognition (deterministic, <1ms)
- **Phase 2**: Template-based natural language generation (<0.5ms)  
- **Phase 3**: ML-based behavioral models (future, target <5ms with BERT/LSTM)

ML feasibility confirmed: Edge-optimized models (DistilBERT, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX) can achieve <5ms inference for real-time behavioral analysis.

## üö® Critical Reminder

**Wave 4 was extensively discussed but NEVER ACTUALLY CODED.** The aggregator.rs file has NOT been modified with the behavioral pattern recognition. This must be the absolute first priority in the next session.
