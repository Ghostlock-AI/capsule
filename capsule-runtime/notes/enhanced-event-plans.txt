  High Priority (Core Infrastructure):
  1. Update SyscallEvent model - Add all EnhancedEvent fields (tid, ppid, exe_path, cwd, uid/gid, resource_type,
  operation, etc.) to match specification
  2. Enhance parser - Extract PID, TID, args, and retval from strace lines instead of just timestamp and syscall name
  3. Update enricher - Populate new SyscallEvent fields directly instead of using separate ProcessContext object

  Medium Priority (Semantic Analysis):
  4. Add argument parsing - Extract fd, abs_path, perm_bits, byte_count from syscall arguments
  5. Implement classification - Add logic to determine operation type (READ/WRITE/EXEC) and resource_type
  (FILE/SOCKET/PIPE)
  6. Add network parsing - Parse socket syscalls to populate NetworkInfo sub-object with addresses/ports

  Low Priority (Advanced Features):
  7. Risk analysis - Implement risk_tags and high_level_kind categorization for security analysis
  8. Latency tracking - Add timing between syscall entry/exit when strace provides both
