# eBPF Syscall Monitoring System

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) syscall monitoring capabilities for AI agent behavioral analysis and tampering detection. The system uses a two-component architecture with **real-time event streaming** from kernel to userspace via ring buffers.

### Architecture Components

- **Kernel eBPF Program** (`src/hello-ebpf-kernelspace/`): Runs inside the Linux kernel, attaches to syscall tracepoints, filters events, and streams data via ring buffers
- **Userspace Loader** (`src/hello-ebpf-userspace/`): Loads the eBPF program, manages attachments, consumes ring buffer events, and provides syscall name mapping
- **Docker Environment**: M1 Mac compatible container with all dependencies pre-installed

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Real-time syscall monitoring** with structured tracepoint access
- ‚úÖ **High-performance ring buffer** communication (kernel ‚Üí userspace)
- ‚úÖ **Process filtering** and PID-based event tracking
- ‚úÖ **HashMap-based process management** for efficient lookups  
- ‚úÖ **LLVM-safe implementation** avoiding core::fmt issues
- ‚úÖ **38 syscall name mappings** for process, file I/O, network, security, and signal operations
- ‚úÖ **Fallback attachment strategies** for different kernel configurations

## Build and Execute Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker with M1 Mac support
- The project runs inside a privileged Docker container with all dependencies pre-installed

### Quick Start

1. **Start the Docker Environment**
```bash
# Start the container (from project root)
docker-compose up -d

# Enter the container
docker exec -it capsule-ebpf bash
cd /workspace
```

2. **Build the Complete System**
```bash
# Build both kernel eBPF program and userspace loader
make build
```

### Running the Syscall Monitor

**Terminal 1 - Start Real-time Monitoring:**
```bash
# Enter the container and start the monitor
docker exec -it capsule-ebpf bash
cd /workspace
./target/debug/hello-eBPF

# Expected output:
# üöÄ Starting eBPF Hello World program...
# ‚úÖ eBPF binary loaded successfully  
# ‚úÖ eBPF program attached to sys_enter tracepoint
# üéØ Starting syscall event monitoring...
# üìä Events will be printed to stdout in real-time
```

**Terminal 2 - Generate Test Events:**
```bash
# In another terminal, generate file operations to trigger syscalls
docker exec capsule-ebpf bash -c "
echo 'Generating test syscalls...'
ls -la /tmp
echo 'test data' > /tmp/test_file.txt
cat /tmp/test_file.txt  
rm /tmp/test_file.txt
echo 'Test completed'
"
```

**Expected Real-time Output (Terminal 1):**
```
[1754759944] üîç SYSCALL EVENT: openat() called by PID 60413 (bash)
[1754759944] üîç SYSCALL EVENT: openat() called by PID 60475 (cat)
[1754759944] üîç SYSCALL EVENT: openat() called by PID 60413 (bash)
```

### Advanced Testing

**Watch Kernel Debug Output:**
```bash
# In a third terminal (optional - for kernel-level debugging)
docker exec capsule-ebpf bash -c "
# Mount tracefs if needed
mount -t tracefs tracefs /sys/kernel/tracing 2>/dev/null || true

# Watch eBPF kernel debug output  
cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe
# Expected: bpf_trace_printk messages from the kernel eBPF program
"
```

**Stop the Monitor:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in Terminal 1, or kill all instances:
make stop
```

### Build Components Individually

**Kernel eBPF Program Only:**
```bash
# Build just the kernel component (target: bpfel-unknown-none)
cd src/hello-ebpf-kernelspace
cargo +nightly build --target bpfel-unknown-none -Z build-std=core
```

**Userspace Loader Only:**  
```bash
# Build just the userspace component
cd src/hello-ebpf-userspace
cargo build
```

### Troubleshooting

**If attachment fails:**
- The system automatically tries fallback attachments
- Primary: `raw_syscalls:sys_enter` (all syscalls)
- Fallback: `syscalls:sys_enter_openat` (file operations only)

**If no events appear:**
- Ensure you're generating syscalls that match the attached tracepoint
- Check that PIDs are > 100 (system processes are filtered out)
- Verify tracefs is mounted: `ls /sys/kernel/tracing/events/`

**Container issues:**
```bash
# Restart the environment
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### LLVM BPF Linker Compatibility

This project resolves several critical compatibility issues between Rust eBPF and LLVM:

**‚úÖ Working Aya Data Structures:**
- `HashMap<K, V>`: Process tracking and PID filtering
- `RingBuf`: High-performance kernel-to-userspace event streaming  
- `bpf_printk!()`: Kernel debug output

**‚ùå Problematic Operations (Avoided):**
- `PerCpuArray.get_ptr_mut()`: Triggers LLVM `core::fmt` errors
- Raw tracepoint `ctx.as_ptr().read()`: Causes eBPF verifier failures
- `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `?` operator: Pull in formatting dependencies

**Key Solutions:**
- Use structured `TracePointContext` instead of `RawTracePointContext`
- Explicit `match` statements for error handling (no formatting code)
- Attach to specific tracepoints (`syscalls:sys_enter_*`) vs raw tracepoints

### Architecture Decisions

**Kernel eBPF Program (`src/hello-ebpf-kernelspace/`):**
```rust
#[tracepoint]  // Structured tracepoint access
pub fn sys_enter_all(ctx: TracePointContext) -> u32 {
    // Process filtering using HashMap
    // Ring buffer event streaming  
    // bpf_printk debugging
}
```

**Userspace Loader (`src/hello-ebpf-userspace/`):**
```rust
// Ring buffer consumer with async event loop
while let Some(event) = ring_buf.next() {
    // Real-time syscall event processing
    println!("[{}] SYSCALL EVENT: {}", timestamp, event);
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Latency**: Sub-microsecond event capture in kernel space
- **Throughput**: Handles hundreds of thousands of syscalls/second  
- **Memory**: Ring buffer provides efficient kernel-userspace communication
- **Filtering**: Early PID-based filtering reduces unnecessary processing
- **Overhead**: Minimal impact on system performance due to eBPF efficiency

### Use Cases

This system provides the foundation for:
- **AI Agent Monitoring**: Track syscalls from processes spawned by "capsule run agent"
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify normal vs anomalous syscall patterns
- **Tampering Detection**: Detect unauthorized system interactions
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time intrusion detection at syscall level
- **Performance Analysis**: Monitor system resource usage patterns
